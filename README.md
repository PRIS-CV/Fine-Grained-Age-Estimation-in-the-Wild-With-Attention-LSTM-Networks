# Fine-Grained Age Estimation in the Wild With Attention LSTM Networks
This work is based on the article "K. Zhang et al., "Fine-Grained Age Estimation in the Wild With Attention LSTM Networks" in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, vol. 30, no. 9, pp. 3140-3152, Sept. 2020, doi: 10.1109/TCSVT.2019.2936410."

Face dataset path: "./datasets"
Copy adience foldx to "/resnet.multiST.torch/datasets" and rename it to"imagenet".
Remember to delete the files in the "gen" directory before changing the data set.
The parameter modification is mainly in the "pre_st_dogs.lua" file under "/resnet.multiST.torch/models"

IMDB data set after cleaning: "IMDB-WIKI(44667).txt"
